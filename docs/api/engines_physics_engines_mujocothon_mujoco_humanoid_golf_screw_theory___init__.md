Screw Theory Module

Implements screw theory representations for rigid body motions and forces:
- Twists (instantaneous velocity)
- Wrenches (forces and moments)
- Screw axes
- Exponential and logarithmic maps
- Adjoint transformations

Screw theory provides a geometric framework for representing rigid body
motions using twists and wrenches in 3D space.
