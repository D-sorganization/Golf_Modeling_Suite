MuJoCo golf swing biomechanical analysis package.

This package provides professional-grade robotics analysis tools for golf swing
simulation and optimization, including:

- Biomechanical analysis with force/torque extraction
- Advanced kinematics (Jacobians, manipulability, IK)
- Multiple control schemes (impedance, admittance, hybrid)
- Trajectory optimization
- Parallel mechanism analysis (constraint Jacobians)
- Motion primitive libraries
- Motion capture integration and retargeting
- Kinematic-dependent force analysis (Coriolis, centrifugal)
- Inverse dynamics solvers
- Telemetry capture and reporting
