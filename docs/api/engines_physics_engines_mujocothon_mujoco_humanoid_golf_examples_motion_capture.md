Examples demonstrating motion capture integration and force analysis.

This module provides comprehensive examples for the complete workflow:
1. Loading motion capture data
2. Retargeting to model
3. Computing kinematic forces (Coriolis, centrifugal)
4. Inverse dynamics analysis
5. Force decomposition
6. Swing comparison

These examples show how to analyze real player swings captured with
motion capture systems.
